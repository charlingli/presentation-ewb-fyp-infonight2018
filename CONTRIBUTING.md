### Pull Requests
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
- Should be made towards the **dev branch**, not gh-pages, which acts as a production branch in this case
- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)

### Bug Reports
When reporting a technical issue, make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are on as well as the necessary steps to reproduce the issue. If possible please include a link to the page where the bug can be tested.

### Pull Requests
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
- Should be made towards the **dev branch**, not gh-pages, which acts as a production branch in this case
- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)
